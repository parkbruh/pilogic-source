	  <p class="info">We are two teenagers that created this website because as we are learning about computers. We feel the need to share what we learnt with the world.
	  We want to try and get people to understand computers and the dangers of them, and we think this is the way to do so.
		  Privacy is a very real concern, and you should feel the same way as we do.
